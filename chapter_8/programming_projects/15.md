Q: One of the oldest known encryption techniques is the Caesar cipher,
attributed to Julius Caesar. It involves replacing each letter in a message
with another letter that is a fixed number of positions later in the
alphabet. (If the replacement would go past the letter Z, the cipher "wraps
around" to the beginning of the alphabet. For example, if each letter
is replaced by the letter two positions after it, then <em>Y</em> would
be replaced by <em>A</em>, and <em>Z</em> would be replaced by
<em>B</em>.) Write a program that encrypts a message using a Caesar cipher. The
user will enter the message to be encrypted and the shift amount (the number of
positions by which letters should be shifted):

```
Enter message to be encrypted: Go ahead, make my day.
Enter shift amount (1-25): 3
Encrypted message: Jr dkhdg, pdnh pb gdb.
```

Notice that the program can decrypt a message if the user enters 26 minus the
original key:

```
Enter message to be encrypted: Jr dkhdg, pdnh pb gdb.
Enter shift amount (1-25): 23
Encrypted message: Go ahead, make my day.
```

You should assume that the message does not exceed 80 characters. Characters
other than letters should be left unchanged. Lower-case letters remain
lower-case when encrypted, and upper-case letters remain upper-case.

<em>Hint:</em> To handle the wrap-around problem, use the expression `((ch - 'A') + n) % 26 + A`
to calculate the encrypted version of an upper-case letter, where `ch` stores
the letter and `n` stores the shift amount. (You'll need a similar expression
for lower-case letters).
