Q: The prototypical Internet newbie is a fellow named BIFF, who has a unique way
of writing messages. Here's a typical BIFF communiqué:

```
H3Y DUD3, C 15 R1LLY C00L!!!!!!!!!!
```

Write a "BIFF filter" that reads a message entered by teh user and translates it
into BIFF-speak:

```
Enter message: Hey dude, C is rilly cool
In BIFF-speak: H3Y DUD3, C 15 R1LLY C00L!!!!!!!!!!
```

Your program should convert the message to upper-case letters, substitute digits
for certain letters (A->4, B->8, E->3, I->1, O->0, S->5), and then append 10 or
so exclamation marks.

<em>Hint:</em> Store the original message in an array of characters, then go
back through the array, translating and printing characters one by one.
