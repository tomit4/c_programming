Q: We discussed using the expression `sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0])` to calculate the
number of elements in an array. The expression `sizeof(a) / sizeof(t)`, where
`t` is the type of `a`s elements, would also work, but it's considered an
inferior technique. Why?

A: Because should the type of the elements within the array, `a[]` ever change,
and the programmer does not change the value of `t`, then the calculation
fail. By using the `sizeof(a[0])` to calculate the length of the array, we
don't have to worry about changing this part of the code later, ensuring
consistency when calculating the number of elements in the array.
