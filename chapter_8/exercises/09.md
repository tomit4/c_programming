Q: Using the array of Exercise 8, write a program fragment that computes the
average temperature for a month (averaged over all days of the month and all
hours of the day).
A:

```c
const float temperature_readings[30][24];
const float avg_temperature_readings_by_day[30];
int i, j, sum = 0;
float avg_temperature_reading_for_day = 0, total_avg_temperature_readings = 0;

// NOTE: Assume population of temperature_readings array takes place here.

for (i = 0; i < 30; i++} {
    sum = 0;
    for (j = 0; i < 24; j++) {
        sum += temperature_readings[i][j];
    }
    avg_temperature_reading_for_day = sum / 24;
    avg_temperature_readings_by_day[i] = avg_temperature_readings_for_day;
}

sum = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 30; i++} {
    sum += avg_temperature_readings_by_day[i];
}
total_avg_temperature_readings = sum / 30;

printf("The Average Temperature Reading For The Entire Month Was: %f\n", total_avg_temperature_readings);
```
