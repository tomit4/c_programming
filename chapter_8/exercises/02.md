Q: The Q&A section shows how to use a <em>letter</em> as an array subscript(index).
Describe how to use a <em>digit</em> (in character form) as a subscript.

A: In your original example, you demonstrate that you can use characters as as
an array like so:

```c
int letter_count[26];

letter_count[ch-'a'] = 0;
```

Where `ch` represents a previously specified character. Because all characters
are integers in C, this works by retrieving the character's number from the in
memory C registry, and subracting the number of `'a'` in C's registry as well,
and subtracting this.

With digits, the method is slightly different:

```c
int digit_count[10];

digit_count[digit-'0'] = 0;
```

Where we look at the address of the character 0 to calculate a similar result.
Both strategies work due to the way that ASCII characters are registered in
order. In this case of subracting 'a' from the `ch` variable, we calculate where
`ch` lies within a range that exists within the range of 0-26.

Similarly, the digit variable lies within a range between 0-9 in the ASCII table
of characters when the character '0' is subtracted from it.
