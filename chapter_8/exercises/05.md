Q: The Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., where each number is
the sum of the two preceeding numbers. Write a program fragment that declares an
array named `fib_numbers` of length 40 and fills the array with the first 40
Fibonacci numbers.

<em>Hint:</em> Fill in the first two numbers individually, then use a loop to
compute the remaining numbers.
