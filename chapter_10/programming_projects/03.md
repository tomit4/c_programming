Q: Remove the `num_in_rank`, `num_in_suit`, and `card_exists` arrays from the
`poker.c` program of Section 10.5. Have the program store the cards in a 5 x 2
array instead. Each row of the array will represent a card. For example, if the
array is named `hand`, then `hand[0][0]` will store the rank of the first card
and `hand[0][1]` will store the suit of the first card.

```c
char hand[5][2] = {
    {'a', 'h'},
    {'k', 's'},
    {'q', 'c'},
    {'j', 'd'},
    {'10', 's'}
};
```
