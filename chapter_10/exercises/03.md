Q: Suppose that a program has only one function (`main`). How many different
variables named `i` could this program contain?

A: As many as there are possible block scopes (technically infinite). Starting
from the file scope, one could declare `i`, then within the `main` function body
itself, as well as as many scopes that are declared.
