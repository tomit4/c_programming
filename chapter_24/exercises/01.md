Q:

(a) Assertions can be used to test for two kinds of problems:

(1) problems that should never occur if the program is correct, and

(2) problems that are beyond the control of the program.

Explain why `assert` is best suited for problems in the first category.

(b) Give three examples of problems that are beyond the control of the program.

A:

(a) `assert` statements should evaluate to true if the program is running as
expected. `assert` should test against implementation defined expected behavior.

(b) Signals are asynchronous, i.e. they could occur at any time and are
therefore outside the scope of something the program could anticipate, for
example if the user is running a C program from the terminal and uses the
classic `CTRL+C` invocation, thusly sending a SIGINT to the running program.
This is not something the programmer can anticipate with any degree of accuracy
and thusly is outside the scope of the program.

Other extraneous, but similar scenarios include the user's laptop running out of
power, or a power outage occurring on their desktop.

Another similar scenario includes a forced update to their computer (not a
problem on Linux, but y'know...Windows, MacOS etc.).
