Q: Which of the following are not legal constants in C? Classify each legal
constant as either integer or floating-point.

(a) 010E2
(b) 21.1E+5
(c) 0790
(d) 100_000
(e) 3.978e-2

A:

(a) not-legal: no preceding 0, indicates octal, which cannot be represented as
a floating point constant
(b) legal: floating point constant, converts to 2110000.0
(c) not-legal: octal, but contains a 9, which doesn't exist in octal
(d) legal: integer constant, can also be written as 100000
(e) legal: floating point constant, converts to 0.03978
