Q: Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `j` is a variable of type
`long`, and `k` is a variable of type `unsigned int`. What is the type of the
expression `i + (int) j * k`?

A: Since `k` is of type `unsigned int`, the expression `(int) j * k` is
converted to an `unsigned int`. This is to ensure that if `k`'s value is too
large of a number to be represented by an `int`, then the result can still be
represented as an `unsigned int`. This same logic applies when adding the `int`
variable, `i`. Thusly, the type of the expression is `unsigned int`.

Answer: `unsigned int`
