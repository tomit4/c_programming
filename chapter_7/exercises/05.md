Q: Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65? (Assume
that the character set is ASCII).

(a) 'A'
(b) 0b1000001
(c) 0101
(d) 0x41

A:
(a) legal
(b) not-legal
`0b` is not a legal prefix in standard C
(c) legal

```
Octal:
1 * 8^2 + 0 * 8^1 + 1 * 8^0
1 * (8 * 8) + 0 * 8 + 1 * 1
64 + 0 + 1 = 65
```

(d) legal

```
Hexadecimal:
4 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0
(4 * 16) + (1 * 1)
64 + 1 = 65
```
