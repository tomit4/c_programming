Q: Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type
`float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. What is the type of the
expression `i * f / d`?

A: In this case, C will evaluate based off of which type provides the most
amount of precision due to this being a floating point calculation. Since the
`d` variable is of type `double`, and `double` has the most amount of precision,
the expression will evaluate to a `double` type.

Answer: `double`
