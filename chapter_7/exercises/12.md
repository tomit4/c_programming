Q: Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type
`float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. Explain what conversions take
place during the execution of the following statement:

```c
d = i + f;
```

A: During assignment, the type of the variable being assigned to (in this case,
`d`), is the type that the evaluation will be cast to. Thusly while the
simple statement, `i + f` would convert or "upgrade" to the type `float` to represent the highest amount
of precision (`float`). The `d` variable, which is declared as a `double` takes
precedence over the type conversion during the arithmetic evalution that takes
place on the right hand side of the assignment operator (`=`).
