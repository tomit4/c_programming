Q: Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of `f`
correctly (assuming that `f` and `frac_part` are `float` variables)?

```c
frac_part = f - (int) f;
```

If not, what's the problem?

A: No, if `f` is negative, then this evaluation would result in a negative
number, which would not return the expected answer, which would be `0`, not a
negative number.
