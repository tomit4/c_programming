Q: Write a program that evaluates an expression:

```
Enter an expression: 1+2.5*3
Value of expression: 10.5
```

The operands in the expression are floating-point numbers; the operators are
`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The expression is evaluated from left to right (no
operator takes precedence over any other operator).
