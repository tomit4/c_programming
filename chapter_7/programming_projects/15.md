Q: Write a program that computes the factorial of a positive integer:

```
Enter a positive integer: 6
Factorial of 6: 720
```

(a) Use a `short` variable to store the value of the factorial. What is the
largest value of `n` for which the program correctly prints the factorial of
`n`?
(b) Repeat part (a), using an `int` variable instead.
(c) Repeat part (a), using a `long` variable instead.
(d) Repeat part (a), using a `long long` variable instead (if your computer
supporst the `long long` type).
(e) Repeat part (a), using a `float` variable instead.
(f) Repeat part (a), using a `double` variable instead.
(g) Repeat part (a), using a `long double` variable instead.

In cases (e)-(g), the program will display a close approximation of the
factorial, not necessarily the exact value.
