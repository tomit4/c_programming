Q: Write a program that takes a first name and last name entered by the user and
dispalays the last name, a comma, and the first initial, followed by a period:

```
Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick

The user input may contain extra spaces before the first name, between the first
and last names, and after the last name.
