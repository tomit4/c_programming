Q: The `square2.c` program of Section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange
answers) if `i * i` exceeds the maximum `int` value. Run the program
and determine the smallest value of `n` that causes failure. Try changing the
type of `i` to `short` and running the program again. (Don't forget to update
the conversion specifications in the call of `printf!`) Then try `long`.
From these experiments, what can you conclude about the number of bits used to
store integer types on your machine?

A: Shortest possible value that will cause failure when declaring `i` as an `int` type is the square root of the `int` maximum positive value of 2147483647, which is 46340. When adding 1 to this value, resulting in 46341, the last square output is:

```c
printf("%10d%10d\n", i, i * i);
```

```
46341-2147479015
```

When changing the type `i` to `short`, the same theory is that the integer will
"wrap" around to negative when it exceeds the square root of it's maximum value
of 32767, which has a square root of 181. Thusly when 182 is entered, this is
the final two lines of the output, signifying a wrap around from positive to
negative numbers:

```c
printf("%10hd%10hd\n", i, i * i);
```

```
181     32761
182    -32412
```

Finally, for type `long`, the number at which this failure occurs will depend on
the cpu architecture it is being run on. My machine is a 64-bit machine, so the
maximum value of a `long int` is `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`, which has a square
root of: `3,037,000,499`. This number is largest than the largest number
available in a `long int` on a 32-bit machine, and while I'll admit I terminated
the program before the count went over 3 million times around, I did not se the
usual negative value associated with the bug seen in the previous two examples,
thusly I can assume that the number at which I would see this bug is
`3,037,000,500`.

```c
printf("%10ld%10ld\n", i, i * i);
```
