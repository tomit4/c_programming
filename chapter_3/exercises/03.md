Q: For each of the following paris of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether
or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be
distinguished.

(a)
"%d" versus " %d"
(b)
"%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d"
(c)
"%f" versus "%f "
(d)
"%f,%f" versus "%f, %f"

A:
(a) They are equivalent, in the second example to the right of the "versus"
comparison, the first space character is ignored by the call to `scanf`, and
the next call takes in the "%d".
(b) They are not equivalent, the space character is interpreted on the right
hand side example as being part of the final string output.
(c) They are equivalent, as the second example's space character is followed by
nothing else and therefore a second call to `scanf` never occurs.
(d) They are not equivalent, as the space character is interpreted in the
example on the right hand side and included in the output.
