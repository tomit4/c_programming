Q: Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:

```c
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
```

If the user enters:

```
12.3 45.6 789
```

what will be the values of `x`, `i`, and `y` after the call? (Assume that `x`
and `y` are `float` variables and `i` is an `int` variable.)

A:
x is: 12.300000
i is: 45
y is: 0.600000
