Books are identified by an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). ISBNs
assigned after January 1, 2007 contain 13 digits, arranged in five groups, such
as 978-0-393-97950-3. The <em>group identifier</em> specifies the language or
country of origin (for example, 0 and 1 are used in English-speaking countries).
The <em>publisher code</em> identifies the publisher (393 is the code for W.W.
Norton). The <em>item number</em> is assigned by the publisher to
identify a specific book (97950 is the code for this book). An ISBN ends with a
<em>check digit</em> that's used to verify the accuracy of the preceding digits.
Write a program that breaks down an ISBN entered by the user:

```
Enter ISBN: 978-0-383-97950-3
GS1 prefix: 978
Group identifier: 0
Publisher code: -393
Item number: 97950
Check digit: 3
```

<em>Note:</em> The number of digits in each group may vary; you can't assume
that groups have the lengths shown in this example. Test your program with
actual ISBN values (usually found on the back cover of a book and on the
copyright page).
