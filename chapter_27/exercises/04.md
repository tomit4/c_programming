Q: Assume that the following variable declarations are in effect:

```c
int i;
float f;
double d;
long double ld;
float complex fc;
double complex dc;
long double complex ldc;
```

Each of the following is an invocation of a macro in `<tgmath.h`. Show what it
will look like after preprocessing, when the macro has been replaced by a
function from `<math.h>` or `<complex.h>`.

(a)

```c
tan(i)
```

(b)

```c
fabs(f)
```

(c)

```c
asin(d)
```

(d)

```c
exp(ld)
```

(e)

```c
log(fc)
```

(f)

```c
acosh(dc)
```

(g)

```c
nexttoward(d, ld)
```

(h)

```c
remainder(f, i)
```

(i)

```c
copysign(d, ld)
```

(j)

```c
carg(i)
```

(k)

```c
cimag(f)
```

(l)

```c
conj(ldc)
```
