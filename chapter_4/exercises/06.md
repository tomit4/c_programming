Q: Repeat Exercise 5 for C99.
What is the value of each of the following expressions in C99? (Give all
possible values if an expression may have more than one value.)

(a) 8 % 5
(b) -8 % 5
(c) 8 % -5
(d) -8 % -5

A:
a: 3
b: -3
c: 3
d: -3

NOTE: C89 and C99 have had updates since the author wrote the book and both C89
and C99 will give the same output for these mathematical computations.
