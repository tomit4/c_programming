Q: Give the values of `i` and `j` after each of the following expression
statements has been executed (Assume that `i` has the value 1 initially and `j`
has the value 2.)

(a)

```c
i += j;
```

(b)

```c
i--;
```

(c)

```c
i * j / i;
```

(d)

```c
i % ++j;
```

A:
(a)

```c
i = 3;
j = 2;
```

(b)

```c
i = 0;
j = 2;
```

(c)

```c
i = 1;
j = 2;
```

(d)

```c
