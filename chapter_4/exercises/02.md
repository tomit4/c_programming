Q: If `i` and `j` are positive integers, does `(-i) / j` always have the same
value as `-(i/j)`? Justify your answer.

A: No, because dividing a negative number by a positive number (the first
case) can cause undefined behavior, whereas converting the division of two
positive integers to a negative number will always result in a defined expected
result/output.
