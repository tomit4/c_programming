Q: Would the `upc.c` program still work if the expression `9 - ((total - 1) % 10)` were replaced by `(10 - (total % 10)) % 10`?

A: Yes, by adding a second modulo assignment in the second case, and omitting
the subraction of 1 while also increasing the `9` to a `10`, you are making
small adjustments to the algorithm that would result in the same output.
