Q: The algorithm for computing the UPC check digit ends with the following
steps:

Subtract 1 from the total.
Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 9.

It's tempting to try to simplify the algorithm using these steps instead:

Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 10.

Why doesn't this technique work?

A: The more simplified algorithm doesn't work because should the modulo
calculation:

```c
remainder = total % 10;
printf("Check digit: %d\n", 10 - remainder);
```

Be a multiple of 10, then the remainder will be `0`, which will result in `10`
being the final check digit, which can only be a single digit, thusly it does
not work when the `total % 10` is `0`.
