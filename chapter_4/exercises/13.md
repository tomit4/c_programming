Q: Only one of the expresssions `++i` and `i++` is exactly the same as `(i += 1)`; which is it? Justify your answer:

A: `++i` is equivalent to `(i += 1)`. This is because both `++i` and `i += 1` increment the value of `i` and then
return the incremented value immediately. In the expression `++i`, the variable `i` is incremented first and then
used in the expression. Similarly, `(i += 1)` increments the value of `i` and then returns the incremented value.

In contrast, `i++` increments the value of `i` but returns the original value of `i` before the increment. Therefore,
`i++` is not exactly the same as `(i += 1)`.
