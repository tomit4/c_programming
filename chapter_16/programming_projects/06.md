Q: Modify Programming Project 9 from Chapter 5 so that each date entered by the
user is stored in a `date` structure (see Exercise 5). Incorporate the
`compare_dates` function of Exercise 5 into your program.

ORIGINAL Q: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two dates and then
indicates which date comes earlier on the calendar:

```
Enter first date (mm/dd/yy): 3/6/08
Enter second date (mm/dd/yy): 5/17/07
5/17/07 is earlier than 3/6/08
```
