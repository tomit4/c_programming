Q: The following structures are designed to store information about objects on a
graphics screen:

```c
struct point { int x, y; };
struct rectangle { struct point upper_left, lower_right; };
```

A `point` structure stores the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a point on the screen.
A `rectangle` structure stores the coordinates of the upper left and lower right
corners of a rectangle. Write functions that perform the following operations on
a `rectangle` structure `r` passed as an argument:

(a) Compute the area of `r`.

(b) Compute the center of `r`, returning it as a `point` value. If either the
$x$ or $y$ coordinate of the center isn't an integer, store its truncated value
in the `point` structure.

(c) Move `r` by `x` units in the $x$ direction and `y` units in the $y$
direction, returning the modified version of `r`. (`x` and `y` are additional
arguments to the function.)

(d) Determine whether a point `p` lies within `r`, returning `true` or `false`.
(`p` is an additional argument of type `struct point`.)

(a) See ./10.a.c

(b) See ./10.b.c

(c) See ./10.c.c

(d) See ./10.d.c
