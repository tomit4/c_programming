Q: Assume that the `fraction` structure contains two members: `numerator` and
`denominator` (both of type `int`). Write functions that perform the following
operations on fractions:

(a) Reduce the fraction `f` to lowest terms. <em>Hint:</em> To reduce a fraction
to lowest terms, first compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the
numerator and denominator. Then divide both the numerator and denominator by the
GCD.

(b) Add the fractions `f1` and `f2`.

(c) Subtract the fraction `f2` from the fraction `f1`.

(d) Multiply the fractions `f1` and `f2`.

(e) Divide the fraction `f1` by the fraction `f2`.

The fractions `f`, `f1`, and `f2` will be arguments of type `struct fraction`;
each function will return a value of type `struct fraction`. The fractions
returned by the function in parts (b)-(e) should be reduced to lowest terms.
<em>Hint:</em> You may use the function from part (a) to help write the
functions in parts (b)-(e).
