Q: Write the following functions. (The `color` structure is defined in Exercise
8.)

(a)

```c
struct color make_color(int red, int green, int blue;)
```

Returns a `color` structure containing the specified red, green, and blue
values. If any argument is less than zero, the corresponding member of the
structure will contain zero instead. If any argument is greater than $255$, the
corresponding member of the structure will contain $255$.

(b)

```c
int gedtRed(struct color c);
```

Returns the value of `c`'s `red` member.

(c)

```c
bool equal_color(struct color color1, struct color color2);
```

Returns `true` if the corresponding members of `color1` and `color2` are equal.

(d)

```c
struct color brither(struct color c);
```

Returns a `color` structure that represents a brighter version of the color `c`.
The structure is identical to `c`, except that each member has been divided by
$0.7$ (with the result truncated to an integer). However, there are three
special cases:

1. If all members of `c` are zero, the function returns a color whose members
   all have the value $3$.

2. If any member of `c` is greater than $0$ but less than $3$, it is replaced by
   $3$ before the division by $0.7$.

3. If dividing by $0.7$ causes a member to exceed $255$, it is reduced to $255$.

(e)

```c
struct color darker(struct color c);
```

Returns a `color` structure that represents a darker versioin of the color `c`.
The structure is identical to `c`, except that each member has been multipled by
$0.7$ (with the result truncated to an integer).
