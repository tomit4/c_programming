Q:

(a) Show how to declare a tag named `complex` for a structure with two members,
`real` and `imaginary`, of type `double`.

(b) Use the `complex` tag to declare variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.

(c) Write a function named `make_complex` that stores its two arguments (both of
type `double`) in a `complex` structure, then returns the structure.

(d) Write a function named `add_complex` that adds the corresponding members of
its arguments (both `complex` structures), then returns the result (another
`complex` structure).

A:

(a)

```c
struct complex {
    double real,
    double imaginary;
};
```

(b)

```c
struct complex c1, c2, c3;
```

(c)

```c
struct complex make_complex(double real, double imaginary)
{
    return (struct_complex) {real, imaginary};
}
```

(d)

```c
struct complex add_complex(struct complex complex1, struct complex complex2)
{
    return (struct complex) {
        complex1.real + complex2.real,
        complex1.imaginary + complex2.imaginary,
    };
}
```
