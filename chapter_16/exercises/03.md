Q:

(a) Show how to declare a tag named `complex` for a structure with two members,
`real` and `imaginary`, of type `double`.

(b) Use the `complex` tag to declare variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.

(c) Write a function named `make_complex` that stores its two arguments (both of
type `double`) in a `complex` structure, then returns the structure.

(d) Write a function named `add_complex` that adds the corresponding members of
its arguments (both `complex` structures), then returns the result (another
`complex` structure).

A:
