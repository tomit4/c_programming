Q: Suppose that `s` is the following structure:

```c
struct {
    double a;
    union {
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    } e;
    char f[4]
} s;
```

If `char` values occupy one byte, `int` values occupy four bytes, and `double`
values occupy eight bytes, how much space will a C compiler allocate for `s`?
(Assume that the compiler leaves no "holes" between members.)

A: 20 bytes. Explanation; The double `a` takes up 8 bytes, and the
`char f[4]
takes up 4 bytes, totaling 12 bytes thus far. The`union e` will only
allocate enough bytes to accommodate it's largest member, as allocating

```c
char b[4]
```

or

```c
double c
```

or

```c
int d
```

will overwrite whichever previous member was allocated their prior. Thusly, the
compiler will set aside only enough bytes to accommodate it's largest member,
which in this case is the `double c`, taking up an additional 8 bytes. Adding 8
bytes to 12 bytes equals 20 bytes.
