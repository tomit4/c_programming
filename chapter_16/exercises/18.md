Q:

(a) Each square of a chessboard can hold one piece--a pawn, knight, bishop,
rook, queen, or king--or it may be empty. Each piece is either black or white.
Define two enumerated types: `Piece`, which has seven possible values (one of
which is "empty"), and `Color`, which has two.

(b) Using the types from part (a), define a structure type named `Square` that
can store both the type of a piece and its color.

(c) Using the `Square` type from part (b), declare an $8$ x $8$ array named
`board` that can store the entire contents of a chessboard.

(d) Add an initializer to the declaration in part (c) so that `board`'s initial
value corresponds to the usual arrangement of pieces at the start of a chess
game. A square that's not occupied by a piece should have an "empty" piece value
and the color black.

A: (a), (b), (c), and (d), all see ./18.c
