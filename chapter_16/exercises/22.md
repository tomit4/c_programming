Q: Let `chess_pieces` be the following enumeration:

```c
enum chess_pieces { KING, QUEEN, ROOK, BISHOP, KNIGHT, PAWN };
```

(a) Write a declaration (including an initializer) for a constant array of
integers named `piece_value` that stores the numbers $200$, $9$, $5$, $3$, $3$,
and $1$, representing the value of each chess piece, from king to pawn. (The
king's value is actually infinite, since "capturing" the king (checkmate) ends
the game, but some chess-playing software assigns the king a large value such as
$200$.)

(b) (C99) Repeat part (a), but use a designated initializer to initialize the
array. Use the enumeration constants in `chess_pieces` as subscripts in the
designators. (<em>Hint:</em> See the last question in Q&A for an example.)

A:

(a) See ./22.a.c

(b) See ./22.b.c
