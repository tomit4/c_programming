Q: Let `shape` be the structure tag declared in Exercise 13.

```c
struct point { int x, y; };
struct shape {
    int shape_kind;           /* RECTANGLE or CIRCLE */
    struct point center;      /* coordinates of center */
    union {
        struct {
            int height, width;
        } rectangle;
        struct {
            int radius;
        } circle;
    } u;
} s;
```

Write functions that perform the following operations on a `shape` structure `s`
passed as an argument:

(a) Compute the area of `s`.

(b) Move `s` by `x` units in the $x$ direction and `y` units in the $y$
direction, returning the modified version of `s`. (`x` and `y` are additional
arguments to the function.)

(c) Scale `s` by a factor of `c` (a `double` value), returning the modified
version of `s`. (`c` is an additional argument to the function.)

A:
