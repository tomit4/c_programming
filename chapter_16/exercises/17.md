Q: Suppose that `b` and `i` are declared as follows:

```c
enum { FALSE, TRUE } b;
int i;
```

Which of the following statements are legal? Which ones are "safe" (always yield
a meaningful result)?

(a) `b = FALSE;`

(b) `b = i;`

(c) `b++;`

(d) `i = b;`

(e) `i = 2 * b + 1;`

A:

(a) Legal, because you can treat an `enum` as an integer, you can set `b` to
`FALSE`, and it will become it's own integer ($0$).

(b) Legal, though potentially unsafe, if `i` is not defined.

(c) Legal, though potentially unsafe, if `b` goes out of bounds (i.e. `b` does
not have a member at `b++`).

(d) Legal, as again, `i` is declared as an `int` and `enum`'s can be treated as
`int`s.

(e) Legal. Again, because `i` is declared as an `int` and `b`, an `enum`, can be
treated as an `int`, it is perfectly acceptable to perform mathematical
operations on `b` and `i`.
