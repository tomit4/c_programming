Q: Which of the following statements about enumeration constants are true?

(a) An enumeration constant may represent any integer specified by the
programmer.

(b) Enumeration constants have exactly the same properties as constants created
using `#define`.

(c) Enumeration constants have the values $0$, $1$, $2$,... by default.

(d) All constants in an enumeration must have different values.

(e) Enumeration constants may be used as integers in expressions.

A:

(a) True, one can demonstrate this like so:

```c
enum integers {
    ONE = 4,
};
```

This will compile and read as expected.

(b) False. `#define` macro definitions are defined on a file global scope, as
opposed to `enum` definitions which are defined only within the block scope of
the `enum` declaration.

(c) True. One can even print out the specific value of the enum, and one will
get that integer back:

```c
enum integers {
    ONE = 4,
    TWO = 6,
};

printf("%d\n", ONE); // prints 4
```

(d) False. One can assign the same value to different members of an `enum`:

```c
enum integers {
    ONE = 4,
    TWO = 4,
};
```

This will compile without error.

(e) True. Because `enum`'s are literally an assigning of its members by default
to an <em>enumerated</em> list of integers, you can use them wherever integers
are expected in C.
