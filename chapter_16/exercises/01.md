Q: In the following declarations, the `x` and `y` structures have members named
`x` and `y`:

```c
struct { int x, y; } x;
struct { int x, y; } y;
```

Are these declarations legal on an individual basis? Could both declarations
appear as shown in a program? Justify your answer.

A: Yes, both declarations are legal. Both structs `x` and `y` have internal
member variabes that are accessible only by invoking their "dot" operator like
so:

```c
printf("x.x :=> %d\n", x.x);
```
