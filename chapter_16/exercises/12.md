Q: Suppose that `u` is the following union:

```c
union {
    double a;
    struct {
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    } e;
    char f[4];
} u;
```

If `char` values occupy one byte, `int` values occupy four bytes, and `double`
values occupy eight bytes, how much space will a C compiler allocate for `u`?
(Assume that the compiler leaves no "holes" between members.)

A:

16 bytes. Explanation: The C compiler treats a `union` differently than a
`struct`. It only allocates enough memory to accommodate it's largest member.
The `union u`, when taken into account without it's `struct e`, has only the
following:

```c
double a;
char f[4];
```

Which accounts for 8 + 4 bytes, which if this were all that was inside of `u`,
then it would allocate 8 bytes (i.e. $8 > 4$).

But we also have our `struct e` to account for. Let's add up `e`'s bytes:

```c
char b[4];
double c;
int d;
```

Since a struct allocates enough memory for all it's members, the total number of
bytes allocated for `e` will be the total of all it's member's allocated memory
in bytes. Thusly:

$4 + 8 + 4$ is the total amount of bytes allocated for `b`, `c`, and `d`
together. Totalling 16. Since $16 > 8 > 4$, the total amount of bytes allocated
for `union u` is 16 bytes.
