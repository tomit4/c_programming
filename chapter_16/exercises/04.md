Q: Repeat Exercise 3, but this time using a `type` named `Complex`.

ORIG_Q:

(a) Show how to declare a tag named `complex` for a structure with two members,
`real` and `imaginary`, of type `double`.

(b) Use the `complex` tag to declare variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.

(c) Write a function named `make_complex` that stores its two arguments (both of
type `double`) in a `complex` structure, then returns the structure.

(d) Write a function named `add_complex` that adds the corresponding members of
its arguments (both `complex` structures), then returns the result (another
`complex` structure).

A:

(a)

```c
typedef struct{
    double real,
    double imaginary;
} Complex;
```

(b)

```c
Complex c1, c2, c3;
```

(c)

```c
Complex make_complex(double real, double imaginary)
{
    return (Complex) {real, imaginary};
}
```

(d)

```c
Complex add_complex(Complex complex1, Complex complex2)
{
    return (Complex) {
        complex1.real + complex2.real,
        complex1.imaginary + complex2.imaginary,
    };
}
```
