Q: Describe a simple way to "toggle" a bit (change it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to
0). Illustrate the technique by writing a statement that toggles bit 4 of the
variable `i`.

A:

You can toggle a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 using the XOR bitwise operator,
`^`, which will flip any bits that specifically are opposites (all 0s become 1s,
all 1s become 0s). We can specify bit 4 of a byte by specifying the 5h index
from the right. When expressed in binary, this is:

```
0b00010000
```

or in hexadecimal as:

```
0x0010
```

See 02.c for more details.
