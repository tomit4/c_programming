Q: Let `f` be the following function:

```c
unsigned int f(unsigned int i, int m, int n)
{
    return (i >> (m + 1 - n)) & ~(~0 << n);
}
```

(a) What is the value of `~(~0 << n)`?

(b) What does this function do?

A:

(a) What is the value of `~(~0 << n)`?

`~(~0 << n)` returns a number with its rightmost `n` bits set to `1`, and all
other bits set to `0`. For example, `~(~0 << n)` would return 0000 1111.

(b) What does this function do?

The function returns a range of `n` bits starting from position `m` in `i`.
