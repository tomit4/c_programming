Q: When stored according to the IEEE floating-point standard, a `float` value
consists of a 1-bit sign (the leftmost--or most significant--bit), an 8-bit
exponent, and a 23-bit fraction, in that order. Design a structure type that
occupies 32 bits, with the bit-field members corresponding to the sign,
exponent, and fraction. Declare the bit-fields to have type `unsigned int`.
Check the manual for your compiler to determine the order of the bit-fields.

A:

See: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ieee-standard-754-floating-point-numbers/

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Structure representing the IEEE 754 floating-point format for a 32-bit float
struct ieee_float {
    unsigned int fraction : 23;  // 23 bits for the fraction (mantissa)
    unsigned int exponent : 8;   // 8 bits for the exponent
    unsigned int sign : 1;       // 1 bit for the sign
};

int main() {
    // Example float value
    float f = 3.14;

    // Pointer to the float value as an unsigned int to manipulate the bit pattern
    unsigned int *p = (unsigned int *)&f;

    // Create a structure instance and assign the value of *p to it
    struct ieee_float *bit_rep = (struct ieee_float *)p;

    // Print the values of the individual parts of the float
    printf("Sign: %u\n", bit_rep->sign);
    printf("Exponent: %u\n", bit_rep->exponent);
    printf("Fraction: %u\n", bit_rep->fraction);

    return 0;
}
```
