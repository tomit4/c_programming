Q: The following function supposedly combines two bytes to form an unsigned
short integer. Explain why the function doesn't work and show how to fix it.

```c
unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
    return high_byte << 8 + low_byte;
}
```

A:

The addition operator `+` takes precendence over the left bitshift operator
`<<`, thusly this first adds the 8 to the `low_byte` variable, then shifts
`high_byte` by `8 + low_byte`. In order to work properly, we'll have to
encapsulate `high_byte << 8` in parentheses like so:

```c
unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
    return (high_byte << 8) + low_byte;
}
```
