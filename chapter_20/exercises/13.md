Q: If `n` is an `unsigned int` variable, what effect does the following
statement have on the bits in `n`?

```c
n &= n - 1;
```

<em>Hint:</em> Consider the effect on `n` if this statement is executed more
than once.

A:

Every time this statement is executed, it clears the rightmost `1` bit in `n`.
If executed multiple times, each execution will cear another `1` bit form `n`,
and eventually, `n` becomes `0`.
