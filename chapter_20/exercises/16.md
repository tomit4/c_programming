Q: Starting with the 386 processor, x86 CPUs have 32-bit registers named EAX,
EBX, ECX, and EDX. The second half (the least significant bits) of these
registers is the same as AX, BX, CX, and DX, respectively. Modify the `regs`
union so that it includes these registers as well as the older ones. Your union
should be set up so that modifying EAX changes AX and modifying AX changes the
second half of EAX. (The other new registers will work in a similar fashion.)
You'll need to add some "dummy" members to the `world` and `byte` structures,
corresponding to the other half of EAX, EBX, ECS, and EDX. Declare the type of
the new registers in the DWORD (double word), which should be defined as
`unsigned long`. Don't forget that the x86 architecture is little-endian.

A:

```c
typedef unsigned char BYTE
typedef unsigned short WORD
typedef unsigned int DWORD /* int is 32-bit on my machine */

union {
    struct {
        DWORD eax ebx, ecx, edx;
    } dword;
    struct {
        WORD axl, axh, bxl, bxh, cxl, cxh, dxl, dxh;
    } word;
    struct {
        BYTE axll, axlh, axhl, axhh;
        BYTE bxll, bxlh, bxhl, bxhh;
        BYTE cxll, cxlh, cxhl, cxhh;
        BYTE dxll, dxlh, dxhl, dxhh;
    } byte;
} regs;
```
