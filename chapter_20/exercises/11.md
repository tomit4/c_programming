Q: Each of the following macros defined the position ofa single bit within an
integer:

```c
#define SHIFT_BIT 1
#define CTRL_BIT 2
#define ALT_BIT 4
```

The following statement is supposed to test whether any of the three bits have
been set, but it never displays the specified message. Explain why the statement
doesn't work and show how to fix it. Assume that `key_code` is an `int`
variable.

```c
if (key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT) == 0)
    printf("No modifier keys present\n");
```
