Q:

(a) Assume that the variable `s` has been declared as follows:

```c
struct {
    int flag: 1;
} s;
```

With some compilers, executing the following statements causes 1 to be
displayed, but with other compilers, the output is -1. Explain the reason for
this behavior.

```c
s.flag = 1;
printf("%d\n", s.flag);
```

(b) How can this problem be avoided?

A:

(a) Because `int` is not necessarily `signed` or `unsigned`, some compilers will
"infer" the signness of the `flag` member of struct `s`. This is because a
`sign` bit can be either 0 or 1 indicating whether the `int` is a positive or
negative 1.

(b) By specifying the type specifier as either `signed` or `unsigned`.
