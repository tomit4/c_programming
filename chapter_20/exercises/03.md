Q: Explain what effect the following macro has on its arguments. You may assume
that the arguments have the same type.

```c
#define M(x,y) ((x) ^= (y), (y) ^= (x), (x) ^= (y))
```

A:

This macro effectively switches the two values by using a series of XOR bitwise
operations.

The first call:

```c
(x) ^= (y)
```

Performs an XOR operation between `x` and `y`, assigning the results in `x`. `x`
now holds the XOR of that operation, effectively encoding information about the
variable (it's value), that can easily be reversed using another XOR operation.

The second call:

```c
(y) ^= (x)
```

Here we now XOR `y` with the new value of `x` (which, again, now holds the
original `x` XOR operation of `x ^ y`). This operation yields the original value
of `x` and stores it in `y`.

The third call:

```c
(x) ^= (y)
```

Performs an XOR operation on `x`, effectively assigning it the new value of `y`
(which now holds the original value of `x`). Very essentially, this completes
the swap between the two variables.
