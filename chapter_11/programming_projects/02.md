Q: Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that it includes the following
function:

```c
void find_closest_flight(int desired_time, int *departure_time, int
        *arrival_time);
```

The function will find the flight whose departure time is closest to
`desired_time` (expressed in minutes since midnight). It will store the
departure and arrival times of this flight (also expressed in minutes since
midnight) in the variables pointed to by `departure_time` and `arrival_time`,
respectively.
