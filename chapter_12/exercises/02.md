Q: Suppose that `high`, `low`, and `middle` are all pointer variables of the
same type, and that `low` and `high` point to elements of an array. Why is the
following statement illegal, and how could it be fixed?

```c
middle = (low + high) / 2;
```

A: The statement is illegal because pointers cannot be added together. You can,
however, subtract pointers.

```c
middle = (high - low) / 2 + low;
```
