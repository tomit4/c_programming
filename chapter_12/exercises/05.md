Q: Suppose that `a` is a one-dimensional array and `p` is a pointer variable.
Assuming that the assignment `p = a` has just been performed, which of the
following expressions are illegal because of mismatched types? Of the remaining
expressions, which are true (have a nonzero value)?

(a) `p == a[0]`

(b) `p == &a[0]`

(c) `*p == a[0]`

(d) `p[0] == a[0]`

A:

(a) Illegal, you cannot compare a pointer and an integer.

All other expressions are true.
