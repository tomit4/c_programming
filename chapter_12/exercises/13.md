Q: Section 8.2 had a program fragment in which two nested `for` loops
initialized the array `ident` for use as an identity matrix. Rewrite this code,
using a single pointer to step through the array one element at a time.

<em>Hint</em> Since we won't be using `row` and `col` index variables, it won't

element should be 1, and so forth. Use a variable to keep track of how many
consecutive 0s have been stored; when the count reaches `N`, it's time to store
1.
