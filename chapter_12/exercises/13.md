Q: Section 8.2 had a program fragment in which two nested `for` loops
initialized the array `ident` for use as an identity matrix. Rewrite this code,
using a single pointer to step through the array one element at a time.

```c
#define N 10

int main(void)
{
	double ident[N][N];
	int row, col;

	for (row = 0; row < N; row++) {
		for (col = 0; col < N; col++) {
			if (row == col) {
				ident[row][col] = 1.0;
			} else {
				ident[row][col] = 0.0;
			}
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
```

<em>Hint</em> Since we won't be using `row` and `col` index variables, it won't
be easy to tell where to store 1. Instead, we can use the fact that the first
element of the array should be 1, the next `N` elements should be 0, the next
element should be 1, and so forth. Use a variable to keep track of how many
consecutive 0s have been stored; when the count reaches `N`, it's time to store
1.

A:

```c
void init_ident(int n, int ident[n][n])
{

	int *p = ident[0];
	int zeros = n;

    /*
     * NOTE: `ident[0] + n * n` points to the memory address of the last
     * element in an n by n matrix
     */
	for (; p < ident[0] + n * n; p++) {
		if (zeros == n) {
			*p = 1;
			zeros = 0;
		} else {
			*p = 0;
			zeros++;
		}
	}
}
```

```c
// NOTE: Stolen answer, modified to address off by one error
void init_ident(int n, int ident[n][n])
{
	int *p = ident[0];
	int zeros = n;

	while (p < ident[0] + n * n) {
		if (zeros == n) {
			*p = 1;
			zeros = 0;
		} else {
			*p = 0;
			zeros++;
		}
		p++;
	}
}
```
