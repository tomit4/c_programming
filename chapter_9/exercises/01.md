Q: The following function, which computes the area of a triangle, contains two
errors. Locate the errors and show how to fix them (<em>Hint:</em> There are no
errors in the formula.)

```c
double triangle_area(double base, height)
double product;
{
    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}
```

A:

`double product` is not declared in the function body.
`height`'s expected type is not declared in the function signature's argument
declaration.

```c
double triangle_area(double base, double height)
{
    double product;

    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}

```
