Q: Write a recursive version of the `gcd` function (see Exercise 3). Here's the
strategy to use for computing `gcd(m, n)`: If `n` is 0, return `m`. Otherwise,
call `gcd` recursively, passing `n` as the first argument and `m % n`
as the second.

```c
// original
int gcd(int m, int n)
{
    int remainder;

    while (n != 0) {
        remainder = m % n;
        m = n;
        n = remainder;
    }

    return m;
}
```

A:

```c
int gcd(int m, int n)
{
    return n != 0 ? gcd(n, m % n) : m;
}
```
