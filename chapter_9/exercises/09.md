Q: What will be the output of the following program?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int i = 1, j = 2;

    swap(i, j);
    printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);

    return 0;
}

void swap(int a, int b)
{
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

A: Because the `swap()` function doesn't return anything, the variables `i` and
`j` does not, as the program indicates, "swap" the values of the two variables.
Thusly, the variables `i` and `j` stay the same, resulting in the following
output:

```
i = 1, j = 2
```
