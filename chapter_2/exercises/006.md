Q: Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent
underscore (as in `current__balance`, for example)?

A: Because convention tells us that the underscore is a delimiter and therefore
we are expecting a delimiting identifier to be put in place by each underscore.
This simply breaks with convention and is probably not a good idea.
