Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is evaluated
using the following formula:

```
((((3x + 2)x - 5)x - 1)x + 7)x - 6
```

Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. This technique
for evaluating polynomials is known as <b><em>Horner's Rule</em></b>.
