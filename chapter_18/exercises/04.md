Q: Let `f` be the following function.

```c
int f(int i)
{
    static int j = 0;
    return i * j++;
}
```

What will be the value of `f(10)` if `f` has never been called before? What will
be the value of `f(10)` if `f` has been called five times previously?

A:

The initial call of `f(10)` will return `0`, but because `j` has been declared
as having `static` storage duration within the block scope of a function, `j`
will retain it's value throughout the execution of the program (i.e. after the
`return` statement, the postfix `j++` will increment `j` to `1`). Thusly, if we
call `f(10)` five times previously, that will increment `j` up to `5`, thusly if
we called `f(10)` five times previously, the value of it's fifth return value
would be `50`.
