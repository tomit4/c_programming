Q: State whether each of the following statements is true or false. Justify each
answer.

(a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope.

(b) Every variable declared inside a function has no linkage.

(c) Every variable with internal linkage has static storage duration.

(d) Every parameter has block scope.

A:

(a) False. `static` declared within a function block has block scope.

(b) False, a variable with an `extern` storage class will have internal (if
declared `static` outside of a function) or external linkage.

(c) True, all variables declared `static` (producing a variable with internal
linkage) will have static storage duration.

(d) True, all parameters declared in a function signature are only accessible
within that function's block scope.
