Q: The following function is supposed to print an error message. Each message is
preceded by an integer, indicating the number of times the function has been
called. Unfortunately, the function always displays $1$ as the number of the
error message. Locate the error and show how to fix it without making any
changes outside of the function.

```c
void print_error(const char *message)
{
    int n = 1;
    printf("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}
```

A:

Simply declaring the integer `n` to have `static` storage duration will tell the
compiler to keep the value of `n` stored during the entire execution of the
program. Thusly we can change it as such to get the desired effect:

```c
void print_error(const char *message)
{
    static int n = 1;
    printf("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}
```
