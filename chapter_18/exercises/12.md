Q:

(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function `f`, assuming that
it's declared as follows:

```c
int (*f(float (*)(long), char *)) (double);
```

(b) Give an example showing how `f` would be called.

A:

(a) `f` is a function that takes the return value from a function that invokes a
pointer to a function with a long as an argument, and a float as a second
argument, and a pointer to a char as it's second argument. The function is
invoked using a double parameter and returns an int.

(b)

```c
int n = *f(g, &ch)(3.14);
```
