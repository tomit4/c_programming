Q: In Section 18.4, we saw that the following declarations are illegal:

```c
int f(int) [];    /* functions can't return arrays */
int g(int) (int); /* functions can't return functions */
int a[10](int);   /* array elements can't be functions */
```

We can, however, achieve similar effects by using pointers: a function can
return a <em>pointer</em> to the first element in an array, a function can
returrn a <em>pointer</em> to a function, and the elements of an array can be
<em>pointers</em> to functions. Revise each of these declarations accordingly.

A:

```c
int *f(int);
int (*g(int))(int);
int (*a[10])(int);
```
