Q: List the storage duration (static or automatic), scope (block or file), and
linkage(internal, external, or none) of each variable and parameter in the
following file:

```c
extern float a;

void f(register double b)
{
    static int c;
    auto char d;
}
```

A:

```c
extern float a;
```

`a` has automatic storage duration, file scope, and external linkage.

```c
void f(register double b)
```

`b` has automatic storage duration, block scope, and none linkage.

```c
{
    static int c;
    auto char d;
}
```

`c` has `static` storage duration, block scope and none linkage.

`d` has `auto` storage duration, block scope, and none linkage.
