Q: Write declarations for the following variables and functions:

(a) `p` is a pointer to a function with a character pointer argument that
returns a character pointer.

(b) `f` is a function with two arguments: `p`, a pointer to a structure with tag
`t`, and `n`, a long integer, `f` returns a pointer to a function that has no
arguments and returns nothing.

(c) `a` is an array of four pointers to functions that have no arguments and
return nothing. The elements of `a` intially point to functions named `insert`,
`search`, `update`, and `print`.

(d) `b` is an array of 10 pointers to functions with two `int` arguments that
return structures with tag `t`.

A:

(a) `p` is a pointer to a function with a character pointer argument that
returns a character pointer.

```c
char *(*p(char *));
```

(b) `f` is a function with two arguments: `p`, a pointer to a structure with tag
`t`, and `n`, a long integer, `f` returns a pointer to a function that has no
arguments and returns nothing.

```c
void (*f(struct t *p, long n))(void);
```

(c) `a` is an array of four pointers to functions that have no arguments and
return nothing. The elements of `a` intially point to functions named `insert`,
`search`, `update`, and with tag `t`.

```c
void (*a[4])(void) = {insert, search, update, print};
```

(d) `b` is an array of 10 pointers to functions with two `int` arguments that
return structures with tag `t`.

```c
struct t (*b[10])(int ,int);
```
