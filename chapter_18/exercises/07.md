Q: Suppose that we declare `x` to be a `const` object. Which one of the
following statements about `x` is <em>false</em>?

(a) If `x` is of type `int`, it can be used as the value of a case label in a
switch statement.

(b) The compiler will check that no assignment is made to `x`.

(c) `x` is subject to the same scope rules as variables.

(d) `x` can be of any type.

A:

(a) is false as variables declared as `const` are read-only constants, but
`switch` statements necessitate the need for compile time constants (i.e.
declared using the `#define` macro).
