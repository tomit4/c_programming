Q: Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that `PI` is a macro
that represents 3.14159.)

(a)

```c
char c = 65;
```

(b)

```c
static int i = 5, j = i * i;
```

(c)

```c
double d = 2 * PI;
```

(d)

```c
double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2};
```

A: (b) is not legal because a declaration with `static` storage duration
requires a constant expression.
