Q: Improve the `remind.c` program of Section 13.5 in the following ways:

(a) Have the program print an error message and ignore a reminder if the
corresponding day is negative or larger than 31. <em>Hint</em> Use the
`continue` statement.

(b) Allow the user to enter a day, a 24-hour time, and a reminder. The printed
reminder list should be sorted first by day, then by time. (The original program
allows the user to enter a time, but it's treated as part of the reminder.)

(c) Have the program print a one-<em>year</em> reminder list. Require the user
to enter days in the form <em>month/day</em>.
