Q: Modify Programming Project 13 from Chapter 7 so that it includes the
following function:

```c
double compute_average_word_length(const char *sentence);
```

The function returns the average length of the words in the string pointed to by
`sentence`.

Original Q: Write a program that calculates the average word length for a
sentence.

```
Enter a sentence: It was deja vu all over again.
Average word length: 3.4
```

For simplicity, your program should consider a punctuation mark to be part of
the word to which it is attached. Display the average word length to one decimal
place.
