Q: Modify Programming Project 11 from Chapter 7 so that it includes the
following function:

```c
void reverse_name(char *name);
```

The function expects `name` to point to a string containing a first name
followed by a last name. It modifies the string so that the last name comes
first, followed by a comma, a space, the first initial, and a period. The
original string may contain extra spaces before the first name, between the
first and last names, and after the last name.

Original Q: Write a program that takes a first name and last name entered by the
user and dispalays the last name, a comma, and the first initial, followed by a
period:

```
Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick
Fosdick, L.
```

The user input may contain extra spaces before the first name, between the first
and last names, and after the last name.
