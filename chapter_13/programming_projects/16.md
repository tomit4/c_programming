Q: Modify Programming Project 1 from Chapter 12 so that it includes the
following function:

```c
void reverse(char *message);
```

The function reverses the string pointed to by `message`. <em>Hint:</em> Use two
pointers, one initially pointing to the first character of the string and the
other initially pointing to the last character. Have the function reverse these
characters and then move the pointers towards each other, repeating the process
until the pointers meet.

Original Q:

(a) Write a program that reads a message, then prints the reversal of the
message:

```
Enter a message: Don't get mad, get even.
Reversal is: .neve teg ,dam teg t'noD
```

<em>Hint:</em> Read the message one character at a time (using `getchar`) and
store the characters in an array. Stop reading when the array is full or the
character read is `\n`.

(b) Revise the program to use a pointer instead of an integer to keep track of
the current position in the array.
