Q: Modify Programming Project 16 from Chapter 8 so that it includes the
following function:

```c
bool are_anagrams(const char *word1, const char *word2);
```

The function returns `true` if the strings pointed to by `word1` and `word2` are
anagrams.

Original Q: Write a program that tests whether two words are anagrams
(permutations of the same letters):

```
Enter first word: smartest
Enter second word: mattress
The words are anagrams.

Enter first word: dumbest
Enter second word: stumble
The words are not anagrams.
```

Write a loop that reads the first word, character by character, using an array
of 26 integers to keep track of how many times each letter has been seen. (For
example, after the word <em>smartest</em> has been read, the array should
contain the values 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0,
reflecting the fact that <em>smartest</em> contains one
<em>a</em>, one <em>e</em>, one <em>m</em>, one <em>r</em> two
<em>s</em>'s, and two <em>t</em>'s.) Use another loop to read the second word,
except this time decrementing the corresponding array element as each letter is
read. Both loops should ignore any characters that aren't letters, and both
should treat upper-case letters in the same way as lower-case letters. After the
second word has been read, use a third loop to check whether all the elements in
the array are zero. If so, the words are anagrams.

<em>Hint:</em> You may wish to use functions from `<ctype.h>`, such as `isalpha`
and `tolower`.
