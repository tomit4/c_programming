Q: Modify Programming Project 11 from Chapter 5 so that it uses arrays
containing pointers to strings instead of `switch` statements. For example,
instead of using a `switch` statement to print the word for the first digit, use
the digit as an index into an array that contains the strings "twenty",
"thirty", and so forth.

Original Q: Write a program that asks the user for a two-digit number, then
prints the English word for the number:

```
Enter a two-digit number: 45
You entered the number forty-five.
```

<em>Hint:</em> Break the number into two digits. Use one switch statement to
print the word for the first digit ("twenty", "thirty", and so forth). Use a
second `switch` statement to print the word for the second digit. Don't forget
that the numbers between 11 and 19 require special treatment.
