Q: Write a program named `sum.c` that adds up its command-line arguments, which
are assumed to be integers. Running the program by typing:

```sh
sum 8 24 62
```

should produce the following output:

```
Total: 94
```

<em>Hint:</em> Use the `atoi` function to convert each command-line argument
from string form to integer form (i.e. `man 3 atoi`).
