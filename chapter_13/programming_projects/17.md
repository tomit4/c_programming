Q: Modify Programming Project 2 from Chapter 12 so that it includes the
following function:

```c
bool is_palindrome(const char *message);
```

The function returns `true` if the string pointed to by `message` is a
palindrome.

Original Q:

(a) Write a program that reads a message, then checks whether it's a palindrome
(the letters in the message are the same from left to right as from right to
left):

```
Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?
Palindrome
```

```
Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam.
Not a palindrome
```

Ignore all characters that aren't letters. Use integer variables to keep track
of positions in the array.

(b) Revise the program to use pointers instead of integers to keep track of
positions in the array.
