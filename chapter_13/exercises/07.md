Q: Suppose that `str` is an array of characters. Which one of the following
statements is not equivalent to the other three?

(a)

```c
*str = 0;
```

(b)

```c
str[0] = '\0';
```

(c)

```c
strcpy(str, "");
```

(d)

```c
strcat(str, "");
```

A:

(d) `strcat` simply catenates to the end of a string the string passed as its
second argument. In the other examples, the <em>first</em> character of the
string is declared to be a null character (i.e. the null character is
<em>prepended</em> to the beginning of the string), whereas in (d) (), `strcat`
<em>appends</em> a null character to the <em>end</em> of the string.
