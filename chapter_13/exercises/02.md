Q: Suppose that `p` has been declared as follows:

```c
char *p = "abc";
```

Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by
each legal call, and explain why the others are illegal.

(a)

```c
putchar(p);
```

(b)

```c
putchar(*p);
```

(c)

```c
puts(p);
```

(d)

```c
puts(*p);
```

A:

(a) doesn't work, putchar() expects a parameter of type `char` not `char *`.

(b) Works (prints 'a');

(c) Works (prints "abc\n")

(d) doesn't work, *p is a string, pointing to the first character of the
`string`, "abc". `puts` is receivingly a single `char`, ('a'), instead of an
array of `char` (i.e. it is expecting a type of `char *`).
