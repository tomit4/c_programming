Q: Write the following function:

```c
void get_extension(const char *file_name, char *extension);
```

`file_name` points to a string containing a file name. The function should store
the extension on the file name in the string pointed to by `extension`. For
example, if the file name is "memo.txt", the function will store "txt" in the
string pointed to by `extension`. If the file name doesn't have an extension,
the function should store an empty string (a single null character) in the
string pointed to by `extension`. Keep the function as simple as possible by
having it use the `strlen` and `strcpy` functions.
