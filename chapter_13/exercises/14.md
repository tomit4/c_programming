Q: What does the following program print?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char s[] = "Hsjodi", *p;

    for (p = s; *p; p++)
        --*p;
    puts(s);
    return 0;
}
```

A: "Grinch" followed by a newline. The expression `--*p` decrements the ASCII
value of *p, essentially dropping each character by one character in
alphabetically order.
