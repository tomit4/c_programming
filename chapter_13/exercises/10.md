Q: The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string.
What's wrong with the function?

```c
char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
    char *q;

    strcpy(q, p);
    return q;
}
```

A:

The string `q` points to will not be accessible outside of the function. Note
how it is initially declared pointing to no string/array of characters. The
compiler actually complains at us that the call to `strcpy(q, p)` starts with
`q` uninitialized.
