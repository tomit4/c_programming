Q: The following function calls supposedly write a single new-line character,
but some are incorrect. Identify which calls don't work and explain why.

(a)

```c
printf("%c", '\n');
```

(b)

```c
printf("%c", "\n");
```

(c)

```c
printf("%s", '\n');
```

(d)

```c
printf("%s", "\n");
```

(e)

```c
printf('\n');
```

(f)

```c
printf("\n");
```

(g)

```c
putchar('\n');
```

(h)

```c
putchar("\n");
```

(i)

```c
puts('\n');
```

(j)

```c
puts("\n");
```

(k)

```c
puts("");
```

A:

(a) Works.

(b) Doesn't work, double quotes indicate a string, not a character.

(c) Doesn't work, single quotes indicate a character, not a string.

(d) Works.

(e) Doesn't work, calls to `printf` expect a string (i.e. an array of
characters, not a single character).

(f) Works.

(g) Works.

(h) Doesn't work, calls to `putchar` expect a character, not a string.

(i) Doesn't work, calls to `puts` expect a string, not a character.

(j) Works, but will print two newline characters as `puts` includes the newline
character by default.

(k) Works.
