Q: Let `a` be an array of $100$ integers. Write a call of `qsort` that sorts
only the <em>last</em> $50$ elements in `a`. (You don't need to write the
comparison function).

```c
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, int (*compar) (const void *,
            const void *));
```

A:

```c
// This works because we only pass the pointer to the 50th element in the array `a`
// This "tricks" the `qsort` into thinking that &a[50] is actually &a[0].
void qsort(&a[50], 50, sizeof(a[0]), compar);
```
