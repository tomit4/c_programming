Q: Show the output of the following program and explain what it does:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int f1(int (*f)(int));
int f2(int i);

int main(void)
{
    printf("Answer: %d\n", f1(f2));
    return 0;
}

int f1(int (*f)(int))
{
    int n = 0;

    while ((*f)(n)) n++;
    return n;
}

int f2(int i)
{
    return i * i + i - 12;
}
```

A:

The output is simply:

```
Answer: 3
```

If we follow the logic of the call stack down, we can see that:

```c
printf("Answer: %d\n", f1(f2));
```

Simply passes the reference `f2` function to `f1`.

Within `f1`:

```c
int f1(int (*f)(int))
{
	int n = 0;

	while ((*f)(n))
		n++;
	return n;
}
```

We take the reference of *f (which is f2 in this case), and we pass it to the
while loop, which checks the output of `f2(n)`. If it returns a true, nonzero
value, then it will evaluate to true and increment `n`. `n`'s initial value is
0. Let's follow it through inside of `f2`:

```c
int f2(int i) { return i * i + i - 12; }
```

```
0 * 0 + 0 - 12 = -12;
```

True., n = 1:

```
1 * 1 + 1 - 12 = -10
```

True, n = 2:

```
2 * 2 + 2 - 12 = -6
```

True, n = 3:

```
3 * 3 + 3 - 12 = 0
```

False, break out of the loop.

Return 3.
