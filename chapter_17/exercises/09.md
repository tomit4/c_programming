Q: True or false: If `x` is a structure and `a` is a member of that structure,
then

```c
(&x)->a
```

is the same as

```c
x.a
```

Justify your answer.

A: Yes they are equivalent. The syntax `(&x)->a` is a hint as to what is
happening. First we reference the memory address at which the struct `x` lives
in using the `&` operator. This is a pointer to whatever lives at that address.
We could just as easily created a pointer to `x` like so:

```c
struct x x_instance;
struct x *p;
p = &x_instance;
p->a = 3;
printf("x_instance.a :=> %d\n", x_instance.a);
```

Which does the same thing. We declare a struct `x_instance`, create a pointer to
an `x` `struct` called `p`, then tell the compiler that the pointer `p` points
to whatever lives at `x_instance`. We then use p to assign it's `a` member the
value of `3`, and this works in exactly the same way.

The more straight forward assignment, `x.a`, works directly with the compiler
without the use of pointers.
