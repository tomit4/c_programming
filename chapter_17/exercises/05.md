Q: Suppose that `f` and `p` are declared as follows:

```c
struct {
    union {
        char a, b;
        int c;
    } d;
    int e[5];
} f, *p = &f;
```

Which of the following statements are legal?

(a)

```c
p-> = ' ';
```

(b)

```c
p->e[3] = 10;
```

(c)

```c
(*p).d.a = '*';
```

(d)

```c
p->d->c = 20;
```

A:

(a) Illegal. The syntax `p->` must have a member name appended to it to be
semantically correct in C. Thusly `p->d.a = ' '` would be more accurately legal

(b) Legal, this is telling the compiler to take the integer value `10`, and
store it in the struct `f`, through pointer `p`, into it's array `e`, at index
`[3]`.

(c) Legal, though I'm not sure about the parentheses wrapping `*p` in this case.
Essentially though, this is storing the character, `'*'`, in `f`'s union member,
`d` in its `a` member.

(d) Illegal. The `->` syntax is legal when referring to `p->d`, but the second
`->` operator is incorrect, as we are not dereferencing the member `d`. The
correct way to access this member and assign `20` to it would be:

```c
p->d.c = 20;
```
