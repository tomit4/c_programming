Q: The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place
in an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list.
Unfortunately, the function doesn't work correctly in all cases. Explain what's
wrong with it and show how to fix it. Assume that the `node` structure is the
one defined in Section 17.5.

```c
struct node *insert_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur->value <= new_node->value) {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;

```c
struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
}
```
