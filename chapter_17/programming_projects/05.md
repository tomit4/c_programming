Q: Write a program that sorts a series of words entered by the user:

```
Enter word: foo
Enter word: bar
Enter word: baz
Enter word: quux
Enter word:

In sorted order: bar baz foo quux
```

Assume that each word is no more than 20 characters long. Stop reading when the
user enters an empty word (i.e. presses Enter without entering a word). Store
each word in a dynamically allocated string, using an array of pointers to keep
track of the strings, as in the `remind2.c` program (Section 17.2). After all
words have been read, sort the array (using any sorting technique) and then use
a loop to print the words in sorted order. <em>Hint:</em> Use the `read_line`
function to read each word, as in `remind2.c`.
