Q: Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that displays
a two-digit number with its digits reversed. Generalize the program so that the
number can have one, two , three, or more digits.

<em>Hint:</em> Use a `do` loop that repeatedly divides the number by `10`, stopping
when it reaches `0`.
