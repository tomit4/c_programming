Q: Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and
displays their greatest common divisor (GCD):

```
Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4
```

<em>Hint:</em> The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclid's
algorithm, goes as follows: Let `m` and `n` be variables containing the two
numbers. If `n` is `0`, then stop: `m` contains the GCD. Otherwise, compute the
remainder when `m` is divided by `n`. Copy `n` into `m` and copy the reaminder
into `n`. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether `n` is 0.
