Q: Add a loop to the `broker.c` program of section 5.2 so that the user can
enter more than one trade and the program will calculate the commission on each.
The program should terminate when the user enters `0` as the trade value:

```
Enter a value of trade: 30000
Commission: $166.00

Enter a value of trade: 20000
Commission: $144.00

Enter value of trade: 0
```
