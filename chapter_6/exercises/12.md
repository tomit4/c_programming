Q: The following "prime-testing" loop appeared in Section 6.4 as an example:

```c
for (d = 2; d < n; d++) {
    if (n % d == 0)
        break;
}
```

The loop isn't very efficient. It's not necessary to divide `n` by all numbers
between `2` and `n - 1` to determine whether it's prime. In fact, we need only
check divisors up to the square root of `n`. Modify the loop to take advantage
of this fact.

<em>Hint:</em> Don't try to compute the square root of `n`, instead compare `d *
d` with `n`.
