Q: Using the `switch` statement, write a program that converts a numerical grade
into a letter grade:

```
Enter numerical grade: 84
Letter grade: B
```

Using the following grading scale: A = 90-100, B = 80-89, C = 70-79, D = 60-69,
F = 0-59. UPrint an error message if the grade is larger than 100 or less
than 0.

<em>Hint:</em> Break the grade into two digits, then use a `switch` statement to
tes the ten's digit.
