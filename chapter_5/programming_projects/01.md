Q: Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:

```
Enter a number: 374
The number 374 has 3 digits
```

You may assume that the number has no more than four digits.
<em>Hint:</em> Use `if` statements to test the number. For example, if the
number is between 0 and 9, it has one digit. If the number is between 10 and 99,
it has two digits.
