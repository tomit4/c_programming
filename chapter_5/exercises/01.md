Q: The following program fragments illustrate the relational and equality
operators. Show the output produced by each, assuming that `i`, `j`, and `k` are
`int` variables.

(a)

```c
i = 2;
j = 3;
k = i * j == 6;
printf("%d", k);
```

(b)

```c
i = 5;\
j = 10;\
k = 1;\
printf("%d", k > i < j);\
```

(c)

```c
i = 3;
j = 2;
k = 1;
printf("%d", i < j == j < k);
```

(d)

```c
i = 3;
j = 4;
k = 5;
printf("%d", i % j + i < k);
```

A:

(a) 1

(b) 1

(c) 1

(d) 0
