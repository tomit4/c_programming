Q: What output does the following program fragment produce? (Assume that `i` is
an integer variable.)

```c
i = 1;
switch (i % 3) {
    case 0:
        printf("zero");
    case 1:
        printf("one");
    case 2:
        printf("two");
}
```

A: It prints:

```
onetwo
```

Briefly, the reason for this is because `i % 3` evaluates to 1 when `i` holds
the value of 1.

The case 1, evaluates to true, and thusly the `printf("one");` statement
executes, however, because there is no `break` statement, the switch statement
continues to evaluate, and all the following statements "fall through".
