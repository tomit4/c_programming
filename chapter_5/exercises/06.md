Q: Is the following `if` statement legal?

```c
if (n == 1-10) {
    printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
}
```

If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to 5?

A: Yes, but it doesn't behave as expected. The subraction occurs first, `1-10`
equals -9, thusly the if statement is evaluated as:

```c
if (n == -9)
```

Thusly if `n = 5`, then `n` does <em>not</em> equal to -9, and the `printf`
statement never executes.
