Q: What does the following print if `i` has the value of 17? What does it print
if `i` has the value -17?

```c
printf("%d\n", i >= 0 ? i : -i);
```

A: In the situation that `i` has the value of 17, then the expression:

```c
i >= 0
```

Evaluates to true (e.g. 1), and thusly the integer printed is simply `i`, or 17.

In the situation that `i` has the value of -17, then the expression:

```c
i >= 0
```

Evaluates to false (e.g. 0), and thusly the returned integer is equivalent to
`-i`, which evaluates to `--17`, which thusly returns 17.
