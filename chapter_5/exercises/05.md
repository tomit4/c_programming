Q: Is the following `if` statement legal?

```c
if (n >= 1 <= 10) {
    printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
}
```

If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to 0?

A: Yes, this `if` statement is legal and does execute from left to right. In the
situation that `n` is equal to 0, the first left hand side of the `if`
statement:

```c
n >= 1
```

Evaluates to false, which in `c` is the equivalent of the number, 0. That answer
is then compared to the right hand side of the statement, equivalating to:

```c
0 <= 10
```

Which is true, thusly the `printf` statement then executes. It is worthy to note
that the first statement `n >= 1` can only ever evaluate to 0 or 1, which will
always be less than 10, thusly this statement will always evaluate to true, e.g. 1.
