Q: The following `if` statement is unnecessarily complicated. Simplify it as
much as possible. (<em>Hint:</em> The entire statement can be replaced by a
single assignment).

```c
if (age >= 13) {
    if (age <= 19) {
        teenager = true;
    } else {
        teenager = false;
    }
} else if (age < 13) {
    teenager = false;
}
```

A:

```c
teenager = (age >= 13 && age <= 19);
```
