Q: Which of the following should <em>not</em> be put in a header file? Why not?

(a) Function prototypes

A:

(a) Function prototypes should be put into a header file.

(b) Function definitions should not be put into a header file, as this could
potentially redefine functions multiple times depending on how often the header
file is included in source files.
