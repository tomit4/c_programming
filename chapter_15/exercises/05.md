Q: Suppose that a program consists of three source files--`main.c`, `f1.c` and
`f2.c`--plus two header files, `f1.c` and `f2.h`. All three source files include
`f2.h`, but only `f1.c` and `f2.c` include `f2.h`. Write a makefile for this
program, assuming that the compiler is `gcc` and that the executable file is to
be named `demo`.

A:
