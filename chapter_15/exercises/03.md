Q: We saw that writing `#include <file>` instead of `#include "file"` may not
work if `file` is one that we've written. Would there be any problem with
writing `#include "file"` instead of `#include <file>` if `file` is a system
header?

A: The `#include` macro when used with the comparison operator braces `<>` looks
for header files within a predetermined location within the system (i.e.
`/usr/include/` on Linux). If one uses the `#include "file"` syntax, it
indicates that the compiler should look for header files by that name within the
current working directory. Depending on the compiler, it will then default to
looking in other locations non the system for a header file by that name,
ultimately looking within the aforementioned system folder. There could be
problems if multiple header files are defined with the same name.
