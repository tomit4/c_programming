Q: Assume that `debug.h` is a header file with the following contents:

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
#define PRINT_DEBUG(n) printf("Value of " #n ": %d\n", n)
#else
#define PRINT_DEBUG(n)
#endif
```

Let `testdebug.c` be the following source file:

```c
#define DEBUG
#include "debug.h"
int main(void)
{
    int i = 1, j = 2, k = 3;
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Output if DEBUG is defined:\n");
#else
    printf("Output if DEBUG is not defined:\n");
#endif

    PRINT_DEBUG(i);
    PRINT_DEBUG(j);
    PRINT_DEBUG(k);
    PRINT_DEBUG(i + j);
    PRINT_DEBUG(2 * i + j - k);

    return 0;
}
```

(a) What is the output when the program is executed?

(b) What is the output if the `#define` directive is removed from `testdebug.c`?

(c) Explain why the output is different in parts (a) and (b).

(d) Is it necessary for the `DEBUG` macro to be defined <em>before</em>
`debug.h` is included in order for `PRINT_DEBUG` to have the desired effect?
Justify your answer.

A:

(a)

```
Output if DEBUG is defined:
```

(b)

```
Output if DEBUG is not defined:
```

(c)

Because DEBUG was indeed defined within `testdebug.c`, and not within `debug.h`.
In `debug.h`, the preprocessor macro `#ifdef DEBUG` resolves to false if `DEBUG`
is not define "somewhere else" (i.e. either here or within another file where
`debug.h` is included). When we removed the `#define DEBUG` preprocessor macro
within `testdebug.c`, this causes the `#else` clause of these conditionals to
return true, causing the definition of `PRINT_DEBUG`, but not `DEBUG`.
