Q: Write a program that tests the `atexit` fucntion. The program should have two
functions (in addition to `main`), one which prints `That's all`, and the other
`folks!`. Use the `atexit` function to register both to be called at program
termination. Make sure they're called in the proper order, so that we see the
message `That's all, folks!` on the screen.
