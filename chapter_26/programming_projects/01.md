Q:

(a) Write a program that calls the `rand` function 1000 times, printing the
low-order bit of each value it returns (0 if the return value is even, 1 if it's
odd). Do you see any patterns? (Often, the last few bits of `rand`'s return
value aren't especially random.)

(b) How can we improve the randomness of `rand` for generating numbers within a
small range?
