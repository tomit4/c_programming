Q: Explain the meaning of the following statement, assuming that `value` is a
variable of type `long int` and `p` is a variable of type `char *`:

```c
value = strtol(p, &p, 10);
```

A:

The `strtol` function converts the initial part of the string `p` to a long
integer value according to the given base `10`. The base can be between 2 an 36
inclusive, or be the special value 0. In this case it converts the string to a
long integer expressed as in decimal notation. The second argument `&p` updates
the string `p` to point to the first character after the last digit of the
number is read.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    char str[] = "123abc";
    char *p = str;
    long int value;

    value = strtol(p, &p, 10);

    printf("Value: %ld\n", value);   // Output: Value: 123
    printf("Remaining string: %s\n", p); // Output: Remaining string: abc

    return 0;
}
```
