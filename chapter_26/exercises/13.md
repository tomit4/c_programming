Q: Section 26.3 described some of the ISO 8601 date and time formats. Here are a
few more:

(a) Year followed by day of year: <em>YYYY-DDD</em>, where <em>DDD</em> is a
number between 001 and 366

(b) Year, week, and day of week: <em>YYYY-</em>W<em>ww-D</em>, where <em>ww</em>
is a number between 01 and 53, and <em>D</em> is a digit between 1 and 7,
beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday

(c) Combined date and time: <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>T<em>hh:mm:ss</em>

Give `strftime` strings that correspond to each of these formats.

A:

(a) `%Y-%j`

(b) `%Y-W%V-%u`

(c) `%FT%X`
