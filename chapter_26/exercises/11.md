Q: Although the `bsearch` function is normally used with a sorted array, it will
sometimes work correctly with an array that is only partially sorted. What
condition must an array satisfy to guarantee that `bsearch` works properly for a
particular key? <em>Hint:</em> The answer appears in the C standard.

A:

For a standard binary search algorithm to function correctly with a given key,
the array only needs to have elements used for comparisons in their proper
positions. For example, the following partially sorted array will work when the
binary serach is told to look for the key `3`:

```
1 2 3 4 5 9 8 7 6 10
```

The search works because the first and last keys are compared, the middle key is
computed, and all of the keys in the first half of the array are used for
comparisons to find `3`.

Addendum:

For bsearch to work with a partially sorted array, the elements accessed during
the search for a given key must satisfy the sorted property. Thusly, because `3`
lands within the sorted portion of the array of elements being searched,
`bsearch` still works. Note, however, that if we searched for the element `9`
instead, this would not work as that portion of the array remains unsorted.
