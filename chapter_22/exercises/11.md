Q: The following loop appears in the `fcopy.c` program:

```c
while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around `ch = getc(source_fp)`:

```c
while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program do
when it's run?

A: The program would compile, but because the logical NOT operator `!=` takes
precedence over the assignment operator `=`, the `ch` variable would always be
assigned the value of 1, and the call to `putc` would never put the correct
characters in the destination file.
