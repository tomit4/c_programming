Q: Find the error in the following program fragment and show how to fix it.

```c
FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r") {
    // read characters until end-of-file
})
fclose(fp);
```

A:

The if statement doesn't check if the file pointer `fp` returns NULL or not. A
classic way of fixing it is to check for NULL and print out an error to `stdout`
using `fprintf` and then exit with an failure status like so:

```c
FILE *fp;

if (((fp = fopen(filename, "r")) == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Could not open file: %s\n"i, filename);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
})

// do something with the file here...

fclose(fp);
```
