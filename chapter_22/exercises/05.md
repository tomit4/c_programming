Q: Is there any difference between the `printf` conversion specifications `%.4d`
and `%04d`? If so, explain what it is.

A:

The conversion specifications will produce the same output for a given integer.
The precision `.4` in the first specification will pad the integer to four
digits minimum, placing the leading zeros if the integer is less than four
digits long. Likewise, the second specification will pad the integer with zeros
because of the given flag `0`, and will produce output 4 digits in length
because of the given field width `4`.
