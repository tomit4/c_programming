Q: Write the parameterized macros that compute the following values.

(a) The cube of `x`.

(b) The remainder when `n` is divided by 4.

(c) 1 if the product of `x` and `y` is less than 100, 0 otherwise.

Do your macros always work? If not, describe what arguments would make them
fail.

A:

(a)

```c
#define CUBE(x) ((x) * (x) * (x))
```

(b)

```c
#define REMAINDER(n) ((n) % 4)
```

(c)

```c
#define GT100(x, y) (((x) * (y))) < 100 ? 1 : 0
```
