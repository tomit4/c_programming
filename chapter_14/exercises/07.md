*Q: Let `GENERIC_MAX` be the following macro:

```c
#define GENERIC_MAX(type)       \
type type##_max(type x, type y) \
{                               \
    return x > y ? x : y;       \
}
```

(a) Show the preprocessor's exapansion of `GENERIC_MAX(long)`.

(b) Explain why `GENERIC_MAX` doesn't work for basic types such as
`unsigned long`.

(c) Describe a technique that would allow us to use `GENERIC_MAX` with basic
types such as `unsigned long`. <em>Hint:</em> Don't change the definition of
`GENERIC_MAX`.

A:

(a)

```c
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
    return x > y ? x : y;
}
```

(b) Because `type##` substitutes only a single token. In the type,
`unsigned long`, we have two tokens, `unsigned` and `long`.

(c) You could create a `typedef` alias for an `unsigned long` like so:

```c
typedef unsigned long u_long;
```

And you would be able to use that in the definition of the `GENERIC_MAX` macro
like so:

```c
u_long u_long_max(u_long x, u_long y)
{
    return x > y ? x : y;
}
```
