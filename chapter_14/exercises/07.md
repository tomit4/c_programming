*Q: Let `GENERIC_MAX` be the following macro:

```c
#define GENERIC_MAX(type)       \
type type##_max(type x, type y) \
{                               \
    return x > y ? x : y;       \
}
```

(a) Show the preprocessor's exapansion of `GENERIC_MAX(long)`.

(b) Explain why `GENERIC_MAX` doesn't work for basic types such as
`unsigned long`.

(c) Describe a technique that would allow us to use `GENERIC_MAX` with basic
types such as `unsigned long`. <em>Hint:</em> Don't change the definition of
`GENERIC_MAX`.
