*Q: Let `TOUPPER` be the following macro:

```c
#define TOUPPER(c) ('a' <= (c) && (c) <= 'z' ? (c) - 'a' + 'A' : (c))
```

Let `s` be a string and let `i` be an `int` variable. Show the output produced
by each of the following program fragments:

(a)

```c
strcpy(s, "abcd");
i = 0;
putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));
```

(b)

```c
strcpy(s, "0123");
i = 0;
putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));
```
