Q: Functions can often--but not always--be written as parameterized macros.
Discuss what characteristics of a function would make it unsuitable as a macro.

A:

Functions that are either recursive or have side effects on their parameters
have different effects within a macro when compared with a traditional funciton,
and therefore are red flags for when one should NOT use a macro.
