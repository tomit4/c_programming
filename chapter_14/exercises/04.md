Q: For each of the following macros, give an example that illustrates a problem
with the macro and show how to fix it.

(a)

```c
#define AVG(x,y) (x+y)/2
```

(b)

```c
#define AREA(x,y) (x)*(y)
```

A:

(a)

I actually couldn't find a problem with this, but if I were to attempt to make
it safer, I'd encapsulate the parameters in further parentheses:

```c
#define AVG(x,y) (((x) + (y))/2)
```

(b)

In the case where you attempt to divide a number, say 25, by the output of AREA.
It will evaluate from left to right as per order of operations. Thusly if, say
you were to:

```c
#define AREA(x,y) (x)*(y)
printf("25/AREA(5, 5) :=> %d\n", 25 / AREA(5, 5));
```

This would evaluate to (25/5) * 5, which equals 25. But what we actually want is
25 / (5 * 5). Encampsulating it as such:

```c
#define AREA(x, y) ((x) * (y))
```

Yields the expected output of 1.
