Q:

(a) Write a macro `DISP(f,x)` that expands into a call of `printf` that displays
the value of the function `f` when called with argument `x`. For example,

```c
DISP(sqrt, 3.0);
```

should expand into:

```c
printf("sqrt(%g) = %g\n", 3.0, sqrt(3.0));
```

(b) Write a macro `DISP2(f,x,y)` that's similar to `DISP` but works for
functions with two arguments.
