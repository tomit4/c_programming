*Q: Suppose we want a macro that expands into a string containing the current
line number and file name. In other words, we'd like to write

```c
const char *str = LINE_FILE;
```

and have it expand into

```c
const char *str = "Line 10 of file foo.c";
```

where `foo.c` is the file containing the program and 10 is the line on which the
invocation of `LINE_FILE` appears. <em>Warning:</em> This exercise is for
experts only. Be sure to read the Q&A section carefully before attempting!
