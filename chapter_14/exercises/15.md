Q: Suppose that a program needs to display messages in either English, French,
or Spanish. Using conditional compilation, write a program fragment that
displays one of the following three messages, depending on whether or not the
specified macro is defined:

```c
Insert Disk 1       (if ENGLISH is defined)
