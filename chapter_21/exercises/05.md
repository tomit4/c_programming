Q: The `islower` function, which belongs to `<ctype.h>`, tests wshether a
character is a lower-case letter. Why would the following macro version of
`islower` not be legal, according to the C standard? (You may assume that the
character set is ASCII).

```c
#define islower(c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')
```

A:

Parameterized macro definitions must be defined only within parentheses and must
evaluate their arguments only once, which the above implementation of `islower`
does not adhere to, as it evaluates the `c` argument twice. This may lead to
side effects unintended by the `islower` macro.
