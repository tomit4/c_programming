Q: Make a list of all reserved identifiers in the "future library directions"
section of the C99 standard. Distinguish between identifiers that are reserved
for use only when a specific header is included versus identifiers that are
reserved for use as external names.

A:

The following is the official section of the "future library directions" from
the C99 standard. This was taken directly from:

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf

7.26 Future library directions 1 The following names are grouped under
individual headers for convenience. All external names described below are
reserved no matter what headers are included by the program. 7.26.1 Complex
arithmetic <complex.h>

1 The function names

cerf

cerfc

cexp2

cexpm1

clog10

clog1p

clog2

clgamma

ctgamma

and the same names suffixed with f or l may be added to the declarations in the
<complex.h> header.

7.26.2 Character handling <ctype.h>

1 Function names that begin with either is or to, and a lowercase letter may be
added to the declarations in the <ctype.h> header.

7.26.3 Errors <errno.h>

1 Macros that begin with E and a digit or E and an uppercase letter may be added
to the declarations in the <errno.h> header.

7.26.4 Format conversion of integer types <inttypes.h>

1 Macro names beginning with PRI or SCN followed by any lowercase letter or X
may be added to the macros defined in the <inttypes.h> header.

7.26.5 Localization <locale.h>

1 Macros that begin with LC_ and an uppercase letter may be added to the
definitions in the <locale.h> header.

7.26.6 Signal handling <signal.h>

1 Macros that begin with either SIG and an uppercase letter or SIG_ and an
uppercase letter may be added to the definitions in the <signal.h> header.

7.26.7 Boolean type and values <stdbool.h>

1 The ability to undefine and perhaps then redefine the macros bool, true, and
false is an obsolescent feature.

7.26.8 Integer types <stdint.h>

1 Typedef names beginning with int or uint and ending with _t may be added to
the types defined in the <stdint.h> header. Macro names beginning with INT or
UINT and ending with _MAX, _MIN, or _C may be added to the macros defined in the
<stdint.h> header.

§7.26.8 Library 401

ISO/IEC 9899:TC3 Committee Draft — Septermber 7, 2007 WG14/N1256 7.26.9
Input/output <stdio.h>

1 Lowercase letters may be added to the conversion specifiers and length
modifiers in fprintf and fscanf. Other characters may be used in extensions.

2 The gets function is obsolescent, and is deprecated.

3 The use of ungetc on a binary stream where the file position indicator is zero
prior to the call is an obsolescent feature.

7.26.10 General utilities <stdlib.h>

1 Function names that begin with str and a lowercase letter may be added to the
declarations in the <stdlib.h> header.

7.26.11 String handling <string.h>

1 Function names that begin with str, mem, or wcs and a lowercase letter may be
added to the declarations in the <string.h> header.

7.26.12 Extended multibyte and wide character utilities <wchar.h>

1 Function names that begin with wcs and a lowercase letter may be added to the
declarations in the <wchar.h> header.

2 Lowercase letters may be added to the conversion specifiers and length
modifiers in fwprintf and fwscanf. Other characters may be used in extensions.

7.26.13 Wide character classification and mapping utilities <wctype.h>

1 Function names that begin with is or to and a lowercase letter may be added to
the declarations in the <wctype.h> header
