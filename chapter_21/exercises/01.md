Q: Locate where header files are kept on your system. Find the nonstandard
headers and determine the purpose of each.

A: On my system, I can find the standard header files in the `/usr/include`
directory. There are many nonstandard headers within my system as well, related
from everything like the X11 client-server architecture to the zip compression
utility.
