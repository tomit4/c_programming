Q: The `<ctype.h>` header usually defines most of its functions as macros as
well. These macros rely on a static array that's declared in `<ctype.h>` but
defined in a separate file. A portion of a typical `<ctype.h>` header appears
below. Use this sample to answer the following questions.

(a) Why do the names of the "bit" macros (such as `_UPPER`) and the `_ctype`
array begin with an underscore?

(b) Explain what the `_ctype` array will contain. Assuming that the character
set is ASCII, show the values of the array elements at position 9 (the
horizontal tab charcter), 32 (the space character), 65 (the letter `A`), and 94
(the `^` character). See Section 23.5 for a description of what each macro
should return.

(c) What's the advantage of using an array to implement these macros?

```c
#define _UPPER    0x01    /* upper-case lettter */
#define _LOWER    0x02    /* lower-case letter */
#define _DIGIT    0x04    /* decimal digit */
#define _CONTROL  0x08    /* control character */
#define _PUNCT    0x10    /* punctuation character */
#define _SPACE    0x20    /* white-space character */
#define _HEX      0x40    /* hexadecimal digit */
#define _BLANK    0x80    /* space character */

#define isalnum(c) (_ctype[c] & (_UPPER|_LOWER|_DIGIT))
#define isalpha(c) (_ctype[c] & (_UPPER|_LOWER))
#define iscntrl(c) (_ctype[c] & _CONTROL)
#define isdigit(c) (_ctype[c] & _DIGIT)
#define isgraph(c) (_ctype[c] & (_PUNCT|_UPPER|_LOWEr|_DIGIT))
#define islower(c) (_ctype[c] & _LOWER)
#define isprint(c) (_ctype[c] & (_BLANK|_PUNCT|_UPPER|_LOWER|_DIGIT))
#define ispunct(c) (_ctype[c] & _PUNCT)
#define isspace(c) (_ctype[c] & _SPACE)
#define isupper(c) (_ctype[c] & _UPPER)
#define isxdigit(c) (_ctype[c] & (_DIGIT|_HEX))
```

A:

(a) Macro names that begin with an underscore and are followed by a capital
letter are defined as being part of the C standard. This is to ensure that their
names are not reused.

(b) The _ctype array will contain bit fields of length 8 that describe the
properties of the characters passed into them.

`_ctype[9]` is a whitespace character and will have bit 5 set: 0010_0000.
`_ctype[32]` will likewise be defined as a whitespace character: 0010_0000.
`_ctype[65]` is an uppercase character, having its 0 bit set: 0000_0001.
`_ctype[94]` is a punctuation character, having its bit 4 set: 0001_0000.
