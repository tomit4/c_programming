Q: Write a program that declares the `s` structure (see Section 21.4) and prints
the sizes and offsets of the `a` , `b`, and `c` members. (Use `sizeof` to find
sizes; use `offsetof` to find offsets.) Have the program print the size of the
entire structure as well. From this information determine whether or not the
structure has any holes. If it does, describe the location and size of each.

```c
struct s {
    char a;
    int b[2];
    float c;
};
```

The output of the program 01.c outputs:

```
offsetof(struct s, a) :=> 0
offsetof(struct s, b) :=> 4
offsetof(struct s, c) :=> 12
sizeof(structure_s) :=> 16
```

Because the printout of the offset for `b` is 4, this indicates that there is a
hole of 3 between members `a` and `b`, as the char `a` takes up 1, and the
beginning of `b` should be offset at `1`, not `4`. Thusly there is a hole of 3
inbetween the two.
