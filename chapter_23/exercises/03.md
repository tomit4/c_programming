Q: Check the documentation for your compiler to see if it performs contraction
on artithmetic expressions and, if so, under what circumstances.

A:

My compiler, `gcc`, supports floating-point contraction, including forming fused
multiply-add (FMA) operations, provided the target hardware supports them.
Contraction is controlled using the `-ffp-contract` flag. By default,
contraction is disabled (`-ffp-contract=off`) in standards-compliant modes
(e.g. - `std=c11`). It can be enabled for single expressions using
`-ffp-contract=on` or more aggressively using `-ffp-contract=fast`. When
`-ffast-math` is enabled, contraction is set to fast by default.

See `man gcc` and search using `/contraction`
