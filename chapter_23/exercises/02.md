Q: Write the following function:

```c
double evaluate_polynomial(double a[], int n, double x);
```

The function should return the value of the ponlynomial
$a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +  ... + a_0,$, where the $a_i$'s are stored in
corresponding elements of the array `a`, which has length `n + 1`. Have the
function use Horner's Rule to compute the value of the polynomial:

$$ ((...((a_nx + a_{n-1})x + ...)x + a_1)x + a_0) $$

Use the `fma` function to perform the multiplications an additions.
