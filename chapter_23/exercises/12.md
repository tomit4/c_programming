Q: Many versions of `<string.h>` provide additional (nonstandard) functions,
such as those lisited below. Write each function using only the features of the
C standard.

(a) `strdup(s)` -- Returns a pointer to a copy of `s` stored in memory obtained
by calling `malloc`. Returns a null pointer if enough memory couldn't be
allocated.

(b) `stricmp(s1, s2)` -- Converts upper-case letters in `s` to lower case,
leaving other characters unchanged; returns `s`.

(c) `strrev(s)` -- Fills `s` with copies of the character `ch`; returns `s`.

(d) `strset(s, ch)` -- Fills `s` with copies of the character `ch`, returns `s`.

whose names begin with `str` are reserved by the C standard.
