Q: Section 23.6 explains how to call `strchr` repeatedly to locate all
occurrences of a character within a string. Is it possible to locate all
occurrences <em>in reverse order</em> by calling `strrchr` repeatedly?

A: yes, `strrchr` acts very similarly to `strchr`, except that it looks for the
last occurence of a character instead of the first. Here is an example of
replacing all lowercase `g`s with uppercase `G`s in reverse order of a given
string:

```c
void capitalize_all_gs(char *s)
{
    s = strrchr(s, 'g');
    while (s != NULL)
    {
        *s = 'G';
        s = strrchr(s + 1, 'g');
    }
    return;
}
```
