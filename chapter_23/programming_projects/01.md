Q: Write a program that finds the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx +c = 0$ using
the formula:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Have the program prompt for the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, then print both
values of $x$. (If $b^2 - 4ac$ is negative, the program should instead print a
message to the effect that the roots are complex.)
