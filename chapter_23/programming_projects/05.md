Q: Suppose that money is deposited into a savings account and left for $t$
years. Assume that the annual interest rate is $r$ and that interest is
compounded continuously.The formula $a(t) = Pe^{rt}$ can be used to calculate
the final value of the account, where $P$ is the original amount deposited. For
example, $\$1000$ left on deposit for $10$ years at $6\%$ interest would be
worth

$$ \$1000 \times e^{.06+10} = \$1000 \times e^6 = \$1000 \times 1.8221188 =
\$1,822.12 $$

Write a program that displays the result of this calculation after prompting the
user to enter the original amount deposited, the interest rate, and the number
of years.
